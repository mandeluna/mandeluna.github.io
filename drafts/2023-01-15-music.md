### Todd Rundgren

This [New Yorker interview with Todd Rundgren](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/todd-rundgren-renaissance-rocker)
reminded me that I had a copy of RA from his Utopia days, so I had a listen —— and I was stunned.

I had completely forgotten about it. My first reaction was that I had heard this before, but maybe I hadn't listened to
it too many times. But no, I put the headphones on, I went for a long walk in the woods, and the emotional reactions
were very familiar. I must have blocked them out.

The harmonies and the lyrics are unique: unconventional but familiar —— the instrumental styles are idiosyncratic but
tight and flowing. It all comes together in a way that is oddly whimsical, and deeply fascinating. As I listened it I
graduallly felt transported to a very particular time and place. And when the last solo in _Singring and the Glass
Guitar_ had finished overwhelming my senses, I was exhausted, and it left me with ear worms for days.

Listen if you dare.

### Luis Gasga

I learned about Luis Gasca from this
[Burning Ambulance blog post](https://burningambulance.substack.com/p/chant-along-with-luis-gasca)
and I immediately checked to see if I could find it on YouTube, and it's fantastic.

Read the whole thing. What an amazing album.
