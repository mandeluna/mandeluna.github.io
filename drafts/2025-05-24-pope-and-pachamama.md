Re. The Pope and Pachamama, by Colm

I liked where this was going

> Since the pope was ill, he had every excuse not to see Vance. While it’s tempting to claim that
the
sight of Vance, all humble and obsequious, might have hastened Francis’s demise, it would be more
plausible to suppose that seeing Vance for a few minutes, and hearing his expressions of gratitude,
allowed the pope to die slightly more content. The footage of Vance being received by the ailing and
unsmiling pope, with Vance looking like an attack Chihuahua who had lost the will to live, must have
given the pontiff and his followers some comfort. The meeting ended with a gift of Easter eggs for
the three Vance children and Vance saying that he would pray for the pope. Vance’s prayers go far.
Attentive readers will know that the last time Vance’s prayers were reported, they had been to seek
the ‘victory’ of US military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. He did this in a Signal chat with
other members of the Trump administration on 15 March, a chat that was shared with the editor of the
Atlantic magazine.

But I was nonplussed by the recommendations.
> The first is the Latin Mass. It is all very well and it sounds good, especially Sursum corda. But
it is code. Those who profess to want its return want many other things too; they are fiercely
conservative and must be kept down.

The purpose of a mass conducted in Latin is ritualistic as opposed to evangelical. It's not a sermon
if nobody can understand it. The moral guidance or social control comes from interpretation, which
is the special province of religious authorities.

Vatican II

This is the America Week ball Tóibín is referring to:
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/conclave-pope-conservative-catholics.html

One of the comments I read on that article noted the decline of the Church in Europe. In the US it
is dwarfed by the 2,300+ protestant denominations. Contrary to what most people believe, the
population of religious people in the US is in fact increasing, both in absolute numbers and as a
percentage of the population.

But Catholicism matters in Latin America, in Southeast Asia, in Africa — basically where populations
are growing.

The Bergoglio Smile
Colm Tóibín on Pope Francis
https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n02/colm-toibin/the-bergoglio-smile
> In The Catholic Church and Argentina’s Dirty War (2015), Gustavo Morello, another Jesuit,
writes: ‘In contrast to the situations in Chile, Brazil, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador and El Salvador,
in Argentina none of the most important dioceses, nor the Argentine Bishops’ Conference as a group,
created any framework to protect victims or to document the alleged abuses. Scholars have been
perplexed by the public silence of the Argentine hierarchy in those years.’

> In 1979, Bergoglio was replaced as Jesuit provincial, becoming rector of the seminary. In these
years, the Jesuits in Argentina were divided between the Peronists and anti-Peronists, with
Bergoglio in the former camp, believing in the need to be close to the people while keeping away
from political theory and, in a sort of sanctified Peronism, encouraging the worship of images and
devotion to the Virgin. Bergoglio’s interest in devotional images was antithetical to Jesuit
culture, as one of his colleagues pointed out: ‘You can’t believe it, he introduced Argentine
Jesuits to popular religiosity.’ He encouraged students to go ‘to the chapel at night and touch
images! This was something the poor did, the people of the pueblo, something that the Society of
Jesus worldwide doesn’t do.’

> This use of apology and aura of humility that he carried with him to Rome was not something noted
previously in Bergoglio, whose meekness, Vallely writes, ‘was not some natural modesty, bashfulness
or self-effacement’. It was, rather, an act of will in the spirit of Jesuit self-discipline. ‘In
Pope Francis humility is an intellectual stance and a religious decision. It is a virtue which his
will must seek to impose on a personality which has its share of pride and a propensity to dogmatic
and domineering behaviour.’

The Council of Florence

> The Emperor, bishops, and people of Constantinople accepted this act as a temporary provision
until the removal of the Ottoman threat. Yet, it was too late: on 29 May 1453 Constantinople fell.
To prevent the Eastern Orthodox Christians from seeking military assistance from the Catholic
states of Europe, the Ottoman Sultans appointed anti-unionists into high church-positions, who
justified the Ottoman conquest as divine punishment for the Byzantine emperors decision to pursue
unity with heretics (i.e the Catholic Church). The union signed at Florence, down to the present,
has not been implemented by the Orthodox Churches.
