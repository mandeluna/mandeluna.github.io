* One of the most powerful predictive models in the physical sciences is harmonic analysis
* It appears in a wide range of domains: light, acoustics, mechanics, at every scale from quantum to astrophysics
  * In climate science Rossby waves form resonant nodes within the jet stream
  * These flows literally shape the surface of the planet
* Less formally, the core concepts — energy levels, frequencies of vibration, resonances, and so on — are also
  widely used in “new age” philosophy and pseudo-religious contexts
* In social media, these terms also commonly appear: people talk about “echo chambers” for example
  * What other examples can you think of?
* Information theory is at the boundary of the social and the physical sciences
* Claude Shannon’s ideas to quantify data revolutionized communication theory in the 1940s, and are now pervasive
  * Anyone with a phone or an Internet service knows about gigabytes and data rates
* To what extent can harmonic analysis be used to measure and predict information and social behavior?
