## The Spirit of Radio

Shortly before it sank in 1912, the Titanic was able to send messages 400 miles away to
Canada, and experienced some cross-talk with The Californian, resulting in the radio operator
telling the other vessel to "shut up" so they could continue their transmission.

The Titanic's radio control room was state of the art.

Spark-gap transmitters
were banned in 1920. Around 1910 vacuum tubes were used to develop equipment that could send "
continuous wave" transmission

AM radio is based on a technique of modulating the strength (or amplitude) of a high-frequency
radio signal. Modern AM radio stations (around 100kHz).

However AM would allow different frequencies to be used, and cross-talk would be less of an issue.
Furthermore, (I assume that) during WW1 the number of ships at sea forced the development of formal
operating procedures (like what you need to get a VHF license, but for Morse code). Presumably a lot
of those procedures have carried over to modern-day practice.

However, what would the range limits be on this technology? What were the practical problems?
Presumably tubes frequently burned out and every vessel would have kept a store of those on board.

The region I am looking at is the East China Sea, near Shanghai, where British, American, French,
and Japanese vessels would all have been operating. Encryption technology wasn't available until
WW2, but presumably different navies and merchant vessels would have code books so they could
communicate effectively and hamper eavesdropping. I'm not specifically focused on military
operations, but more how merchant vessels and military ships coordinated their activities with each
other and with land stations.

At the start of WW1, under
the direction of Herbert Hoover, the US Navy took over the operation of most of the radio
transmitters in the United States. This continued for some time after the war (in fact the Navy
tried to maintain a monopoly but their efforts were blocked by Congress), but the upshot is that, by
and large, Navy procedures developed during the war established the standards for decades to come.

A big chunk of the radio spectrum was dedicated to sending text messages, largely because so
many messages were needed, and the bandwidth required for voice transmission was excessive.
Verbal messages were also less reliable. Every text message sent via Morse code was transcribed
and logged.

The operating procedures described in this
document https://navy-radio.com/manuals/10228d/rm32_manual_64-06.pdf explain a lot of the essential
protocols I was wondering about. The Morse alphabet only describes the Latin character set, but
Morse prosigns and abbreviations provided a way for operators to communicate effectively, and in
fact also established standard protocols for switching from Latin codes to Japanese.
Not only were radio operators required to maintain a high level of skill and facility in
transmitting messages, but there were well-defined roles for others to listen and transcribe
messages on a scheduled shift (these are described in the 1964 operations manual above).
