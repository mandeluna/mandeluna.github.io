## The Spirit of Radio

Shortly before it sank in 1912, the Titanic was able to send messages four hundred miles away to
Canada, and experienced some radio cross-talk with The Californian, which unfortunately shut
down its
radio operations half an before the more famous vessel started sending distress signals. "At 9.05 pm
about two and a half hours before the collision with the iceberg, the CALIFORNIAN sent 'We are
stopped and surrounded by
ice.' The reply from the TITANIC was 'Shut up. I am busy. I am working Cape Race' Cyril Evans, the
operator on the CALIFORNIAN, stated to the British inquiry that he was not insulted by this rebuff
as the larger or faster ships took preference in sending their traffic."[^titanic]

The recovery of Titanic's radio control room was delayed by lawsuits but finally allowed to
proceed in May 2024, however those plans were shelved after the loss of the CEO of the company,
who was a crew member of the Titan submersible, which was lost with all aboard in June 2023.

The Marconi equipment on board the Titanic was state of the art for the time. It used a large
amount of energy in a high voltage circuit to produce a large spark between a pair of electrodes. A
short duration spark would represent a "dot" in Morse code, and a slightly longer duration
spark would represent a "dash." While conceptually quite simple, the generators were massive and
extremely inefficient, and they also produced a large amount of interference that would hinder
the detailed communication required to coordinate large fleets of ships.

Furthermore, even by 1917, the radio installations on British and American navies were
incompatible.   

Spark-gap transmitters
were banned in 1920. Around 1910 vacuum tubes were used to develop equipment that could send "
continuous wave" transmission.

While vacuum tubes were initially very expensive, The US Navy

AM radio is based on a technique of modulating the strength (or amplitude) of a high-frequency
radio signal. Modern AM radio stations (around 100kHz).

However AM would allow different frequencies to be used, and cross-talk would be less of an issue.
Furthermore, (I assume that) during WW1 the number of ships at sea forced the development of formal
operating procedures (like what you need to get a VHF license, but for Morse code). Presumably a lot
of those procedures have carried over to modern-day practice.

However, what would the range limits be on this technology? What were the practical problems?
Presumably tubes frequently burned out and every vessel would have kept a store of those on board.

The region I am looking at is the East China Sea, near Shanghai, where British, American, French,
and Japanese vessels would all have been operating. Encryption technology wasn't available until
WW2, but presumably different navies and merchant vessels would have code books so they could
communicate effectively and hamper eavesdropping. I'm not specifically focused on military
operations, but more how merchant vessels and military ships coordinated their activities with each
other and with land stations.

At the start of WW1, under
the direction of Herbert Hoover, the US Navy took over the operation of most of the radio
transmitters in the United States. This continued for some time after the war (in fact the Navy
tried to maintain a monopoly but their efforts were blocked by Congress), but the upshot is that, by
and large, Navy procedures developed during the war established the standards for decades to come.

A big chunk of the radio spectrum was dedicated to sending text messages, largely because so
many messages were needed, and the bandwidth required for voice transmission was excessive.
Verbal messages were also less reliable. Every text message sent via Morse code was transcribed
and logged.

The operating procedures described in this
document https://navy-radio.com/manuals/10228d/rm32_manual_64-06.pdf explain a lot of the essential
protocols I was wondering about. The Morse alphabet only describes the Latin character set, but
Morse prosigns and abbreviations provided a way for operators to communicate effectively, and in
fact also established standard protocols for switching from Latin codes to Japanese.
Not only were radio operators required to maintain a high level of skill and facility in
transmitting messages, but there were well-defined roles for others to listen and transcribe
messages on a scheduled shift (these are described in the 1964 operations manual above).
