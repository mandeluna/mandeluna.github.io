## Mass delusions

Le Bon claims that there are several characteristics of crowd psychology: "impulsiveness, irritability, incapacity to
reason, the absence of judgement of the critical spirit, the exaggeration of sentiments, and others...." Le Bon claimed
that "an individual immersed for some length of time in a crowd soon finds himself – either in consequence of magnetic
influence given out by the crowd or from some other cause of which we are ignorant – in a special state, which much
resembles the state of fascination in which the hypnotized individual finds himself in the hands of the hypnotizer."

the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes
them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and
act were he in a state of isolation.

1. Power: the individual forming part of a crowd acquires, solely from numerical considerations, a sentiment of
   invincible power which allows him to yield to instincts which, had he been alone, he would perforce have kept under
   restraint.
2. Contagion: every sentiment and act is contagious, and contagious to such a degree that an individual readily
   sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest.
3. Suggestibility: the individuals of a crowd special characteristics which are quite contrary at times to those
   presented by the isolated individual.

He is no longer conscious of his acts. In his case, as in the case of the hypnotised subject, at the same time that
certain faculties are destroyed, others may be brought to a high degree of exaltation. Under the influence of a
suggestion, he will undertake the accomplishment of certain acts with irresistible impetuosity.

Like Le Bon, Freud says that as part of the mass, the individual acquires a sense of infinite power allowing him to act
on impulses that he would otherwise have to curb as an isolated individual. These feelings of power and security allow
the individual not only to act as part of the mass, but also to feel safety in numbers. This is accompanied, however, by
a loss of conscious personality and a tendency of the individual to be infected by any emotion within the mass, and to
amplify the emotion, in turn, by "mutual induction". Overall, the mass is "impulsive, changeable, and irritable. It is
controlled almost exclusively by the unconscious."

The renunciation of all its privileges which the nobility voted in a moment of enthusiasm during the celebrated night of
August 4, 1789, would certainly never have been consented to by any of its members taken singly.
