The Antikythera mechanism is an artifact discovered in an ancient shipwreck in 1901, believed to have been built between
200 BCE and 87 BCE, and lost at sea between about 70-60 BCE.

Some remarkable efforts in recent years to recreate a model of the mechanism are nicely summed up in this paper. From
highly detailed three-dimensional X-Ray images the authors were able to decipher the gear ratios used to determine the
epicycles from text hidden within the machine. They then constructed 3D computer models and a working version of the
machine from brass.
