    5. Governable Spaces: Democracy as a Policy Strategy
    Epilogue: Metagovernance

## Governable Stacks
Heavily influenced by Marxist writers.

Terms
* _digital colonialism_ — forms of domination by governments and corporations through their
  control over internet technologies.
* _governable stacks_ — the interconnected infrastructures and practices that enable networked self-governance.
* _modular politics_ — how governable stacks could replace implicit feudalism.
* _governance archaeology_ — the work of filling governable stacks with lessons from ancestors
  across diverse times and places.

### To Struggle Against Governance
Cautious support of spontaneity as an ideal, with criticisms from Lenin who saw spontaneous acts
as "a fungus."  Rosa Luxemburg wanted a model that supported humanity but her movement was
overwhelmed by the advance of Soviet tanks and the erection of the Berlin wall.  James
recommended sortition, choosing elected officials by lottery.

### Virality as a Colonizing Strategy
Social media at first appeared to have the ability to transform political discourse and create a
form of radical democracy, but it has failed to support persistent organizations.

The collapse of the Arab Spring, the unrealized potential of Occupy Wall Street are described in
Tufecki[^tufecki] as authoritarian voices learned how to drown dissent in a "deluge of obfuscation."
