### Hopes and plans for 2023

2022 was a big year.

It is the first year since I was in school that I haven't worked full-time. One of the
most surprising things about that is how much you can actually get done when you aren't
dealing with work responsibilities, and there has been a lot going on in the world after
the shutdown of the past two years.

This review is mostly chronological, but some important themes dominated the year. I also read
a lot of books, and listened to a lot of audiobooks.

I think my comments from my own perspective will be more interesting if I
can relate them to some of what I've read.

I hate to say I "finally finished" a book. For a book never really goes away; I hope that
many of mine will stick around long after I'm gone. Of course that is more true of printed
books, which can be much more easily loaned, borrowed, or given away, than their electronic
editions. It also sounds like I'm describing a chore. Of course some books are challenging
to read — new ideas are always difficult to accept. If you're not learning something, then
why are you even reading, when you could instead be exploring the world and learning with
all your senses?

### Climate

We've had an unusually dry and warm Winter here, but in December the polar vortex locked in
on the South Coast and we had about a week of snow. Soon after the warm Pacific air pushed
it away, just in time for the King tides, which were at a record high this year. In January
a similar event washed away the Stanley Park seawall, raising the question of how long it
can be maintained.

_The Corps and the Shore_ is a fascinating analysis of several prominent coastal areas that
the United States Coast Guard has been tasked with maintaining. The


### Twitter

The biggest tech news of 2022 was Elon Musk buying Twitter, promptly driving it into the
ground, and taking Tesla along with it. While I've never had any financial interest in Twitter
or Tesla, I spend a lot of time on Twitter, and like most of the people there, I care about
the platform.

Even though I have been active there for over 12 years, I never felt I was using it
effectively. There's a whole industry that's arisen around Twitter to help people use it
strategically, but I've mostly tended to react to things. My early attempts at blogging
were like that too.

Musk’s bizarre acquisition of the platform drove many people away, and I archived my 12 years of
snarky posts, pictures of food and travel, and commentary about technology and industry events
that varied from superficial and naive to reasonably insightful.

In hindsight, it should be fairly straightforward to put together a short list of some of the
more interesting observations of the past year, with a little commentary where it’s useful.

A lot of people have jumped over to Mastodon, a decentralized blogging platform, similar to
Twitter, but it’s much less polished and it will take some time to establish traction.
It is a federated system. Unlike a peer-to-peer network where all actors communicate directly
with one another, there are a number of servers, each with hundreds or thousands of clients.
The central idea of federation has the benefit that people are not locked into a particular
service. If one

It might be a good way to leverage some of the blockchain enthusiasm from the crypto collapse —
another big news item from 2022 — into a new social media concept. With the explosion of
realistic AI tools for generating text and artwork makes a trifecta of tech news this year, and
tools to verify identity and authorship will be valuable.

The underlying protocol for Mastodon is an Internet standard called ActivityPub, which defines
message formats and communication endpoints for a federated social media platform. The message
format is a variant of JSON for linked data, called JSON-ld, and I plan to experiment with
adding digital signatures and content hashes to create a distributed ledger for the social web.

### Ukraine

For most of the year I closely followed Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
I put together a [list of sources](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1511498649682866179) over the
course of the year to try and understand what was happening. The speed of the collapse of
the Russian attack has been astonishing, and the overwhelming extent of the destruction the
invaders has wrought is heartbreaking. The cynical prediction that people will get tired of
it is coming true, but much more slowly than the Russians may have expected.

### Supply Chain Logistics

### Freedom

One of the strangest and most unexpected events in Canadian politics has been the emergence
of the so-called Freedom Convoy. Maybe it only seems strange to me because I haven't been paying
attention to what's been happening in my own backyard, but I found the timing odd, given
the immediate terror facing the Ukrainian people, and the fact that the mask and vaccination
mandates that were allegedly being protested had already been lifted by the time the protests
started. But I suppose people have the right to protest, and no protest in history has ever
been intellectually coherent.

Freedom means a lot of different things, depending on whom you talk to.

Anna Loenhaupt Tsing talked to a lot of people about freedom, in an unexpected nexus of
culture deep within the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, where
a vibrant economy of matsutake mushroom hunters harvest the valuable fruit for sale in
Japan. The supply chain extends to the boreal forests in Finland and China, but it is in
Oregon where she encounters an unlikely community of Vietnam veterans, immigrants from Laos,
Cambodia and Japan, and native Americans, all who have very different, but very explicit
ideas of the freedom that motivates their work.

The western concept of freedom arose during the Enlightenment, according to David Graeber
and David Wengrow

Jean-Jacques Rousseau won an essay competition by writing about freedom, his _Discourse
on the Arts and Sciences_, where he emphatically asserted that the progress of the sciences
and the arts has indeed led to moral corruption. This atavistic tendency resonated as well
in the 18th century as it does today, and indeed it still drives much of the conservative
movement.

But his second submission to the academy was poorly received. In response to the question
‘What is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?’ Rousseau
gave a pessimistic summary of the whole course of history. The Discourse on the Origin and
the Foundations of Inequality among Men takes its readers back to the very beginnings of
history, to the putative state of nature.

Robertson, Ritchie. The Enlightenment (p. 694). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.

When our ancestors, Rousseau wrote, made the fatal decision to divide the earth into individually owned plots, creating legal structures to protect their property, then governments to enforce those laws, they imagined they were creating the means to preserve their liberty. In fact, they ‘ran headlong to their chains’.

Graeber, David. The Dawn of Everything (p. 67). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

Thérèse Le Vasseur bore him five children, all of whom, much against their mother’s wishes,
he sent to the Paris foundling hospital (Hôpital des Enfants-Trouvés), where they faced to almost
certain death.[^1]

Later he wrote _Émile_, which launched him into infamy. He was forced to flee Paris after
the Parlement ordered his arrest, but his beloved Geneva also rejected him, but he was saved
by the favour of Frederick the Great.

The reign of Frederick the Great is recounted, in almost slapstick style, in Umberto Eco's
_Baudolino_, from the perspective of the Fourth Crusade, during the Sack of Constantinople.
Interestingly, Eco does not spend much time on Frederick's interactions with Voltaire or
Rousseau, both of whom corresponded and visited him. While the King was preoccupied with the
Seven Years War, the eponymous narrator was being educated in Paris drinking houses and
brothels, and perhaps never had time to meet with the enlighteners of the period, or perhaps
he did.

### Crypto

### Games

I spent most of 2022 working on my RPG platform. It stalled around the end of October when I
tried to implement a level editor into the web GUI, with limited success. I decided to switch
gears and build a tile-based game around old-fashioned sailing ships. I made some good progress
with that, but the game concept is not completely defined, and it looks like a major project.

We mostly stopped our role-playing gaming sessions around August.

[FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) — the virtual tabletop
system we have been using — was performing poorly on Jeff’s machine so we just sort of stopped.
The story I had been working through had lost its way. It would be nice to revisit the platform
and the story to see if I can find a way to make it grow.

### Travel

_Wells Gray Camping, 8 days in June_

It rained and it rained, and the river raged. Enormous standing waves and atmospheric resonances
produced complex sounds, that over long periods of isolation, and with a sprinkling of auditory pareidolia could easily produce intricate delusions.

Edmonton visit, plus another night camping, in July

Bike trip to the Okanagan in October

### Predictions

I don’t like predictions, but let’s be honest, predictions are a pretty valuable survival
mechanism, and arguably, why we have brains. So I will not shirk from this responsibility, even
if that sounds like a resolution.

### Bibliography

Piranesi<br>
_Susanna Clarke_

While we were in Ucluelet in January I was listening to Susanna Clarke’s Piranesi on audiobook,
an absolutely wonderful story that skilfully balances an imagined underworld — reminiscent of
that of Faerie in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, and the Ladies of Grace Adieu, and other
stories — and the real trauma and desperate isolation and abuse faced by people suffering from
mental illness.

Unlike those stories, it is set in present times, and instead of gothic romance, it places the
reader in an immediately unfamiliar and odd setting of a vast labyrinth of a house filled with
statues, unpredictable tidal events, sea birds, skeletons, glimpses into modern day Manchester,
memories, and subtly revealing scraps of clues. It is heartbreaking and moving but at the same
time an enjoyable mystery unravels as the details of the narrators circumstances unfold.

Deep Learning with Python (2nd ed.)<br>
_François Chollet_

I ordered this from the publisher after Conor recommended that I might be interested in learning
more about the mathematical basis for Machine Learning. The second chapter explains this basis
quite well — it’s certainly helpful if you understand the basics of linear algebra and calculus,
and a little bit of numerical methods, but there is not a lot of deep math involved, and most of
the book is about stitching together various layers of operations using Chollet’s Keras toolset,
which has now been incorporated into Google’s Tensor Flow product.

Tensor Flow is somewhat less popular than PyTorch, Facebook’s open source platform, but the
concepts are largely the same. For the first few chapters I worked through the examples, both in
TF and PyTorch. I was interested in how well some of these models would run on Apple’s new GPU
architecture, but after a while, it begins to feel like, if you haven’t got a big budget for
computer hardware, there’s not much point to it.

I used to enjoy putting together complex computer systems, but the heavy funding requirements
means that to play with this stuff you need to either be working for a big company, or to build
a startup and chase the funds and deal with the politics of funding a startup. I stopped reading
around the chapter on language Transformers.

Ironically this is the topic that had interested me the most, and the techniques for encoding
long runs of text seem to be an active area of research, but I don’t feel particularly
passionate about it right now, especially with all the attention that GPT chat tools have been
getting.

If you’re hopping on the bandwagon for the hot new thing, I guess this book is a must read. It’s
well-written, insightful, and provides expert level background on the most important ideas in
deep learning. Deep learning and large language models are not high on my priority list for
2023, but I might change my mind.

Horizon<br>
_Barry Lopez_

Thrombolites near the beach in azure water in Lake Clifton, one of the Yalgorup lakes,
illuminated by the setting sun, alongside an observation boardwalk. The lake is situated in a
national park, about 100km south of Perth, on the west coast of Australia.

"These pale hummocks of "living stone" are believed to be about four thousand years old. The
cyanobacteria that create them are photosynthesizers, and it's the residue from this process, a
secretion rich in calcium carbonate, that comprises the thrombolites." — Barry Lopez, Horizon

This book took me months to read, but I credit it for helping me establish discipline in daily
reading. It’s not particularly difficult to read, but it’s a personal story, and Lopez
reexamines some events that occurred in the context of his earlier books.

I first encountered Barry Lopez from a quote I found on Twitter, and then shared on Facebook,
without knowing its source, which was from the introduction of a book of essays called About
This Life. Karen bought it for me for Christmas in about 2017, and it is an absolutely beautiful
collection.

I never read Arctic Dreams until 2019, when I was still living in California. Even though that
book was published in 1984, and much of the distressing environmental degradation that Lopez
lamented has progressed far beyond that already terrible situation at that time, it’s a
wonderful introduction to the natural history of the region, and remarkably free of much of the
social criticism of guns and hunting activities that are such an essential part of the culture
of the Inuit. The chapters on Musk Oxen, narwhals, the Greenland shark and Beluga whales are all
enlightening, even if they’re much harder to read now that so much Arctic wildlife is so close
to being completely destroyed.

Medieval Pirates<br>
_Jill Eddison_

I read this book in December, ostensibly as research for my Pirate Game. I found it in this
Reddit
post https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9220hx/did_ships_fly_flagsbanners_in_the_1300s_in_europe/

This is a detailed, but highly readable account of shipping and piracy from 1204 until 1453,
covering the rule of Henry II up until the end of the Hundred Years War.

Shipping technology evolved dramatically during this period. As merchants from Venice and Genoa
learned how to traverse the Strait of Gibraltar the high-hulled cogs built to withstand the
storms and high waves of the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean combined features of the Galleys and
Galleas of the Mediterranean. The French and (belatedly, at least under Henry V) the English
began to take naval construction seriously instead of relying on commandeering of merchant
vessels, whose loyalties were unpredictable and often critical, not only for military
adventures, but often the ability of both coastal and inland communities to feed and clothe
themselves.

Some fascinating stories about communities of pirates that dominated the sea trade of the Late
Medieval period subsequently declined due to shifting shorelines and their inability to protect
themselves from sea raiders with stronger alliances.

Birds of Prey<br>
_Wilbur Smith_

Mason & Dixon<br>
_Thomas Pynchon_

I read Gravity’s Rainbow in my grandparent’s attic suite in Kingston, when I was 20 years old.
It shocked the daylights out of me, and even though I got through it, I was hesitant to pick up
another Pynchon novel. Yet,— Paul reassured me that Mason & Dixon was one of his more
“accessible” novels;— it is considered one of the great works of late 20th century American
literature, and hey,— sailing ships. What’s not to like?

I loved the chaotic energy of the first part of this book. Every stop at port is memorable, from
the drunken encounter with what was probably not a talking dog, Dixon’s illicit culinary
adventures in Good Hope, with Mason reluctantly following along in a frustrated attempt to avoid
sexual entrapment and inappropriate levels of overcooked mutton by the wife and daughters of the
Cornelius Vroom, while trying to observe the Transit of Venus (nudge nudge), the escape to the
terrifying island of Saint Helena where Mason comes to the aid of a suicidal soldier, all told
from the perspective of a Rev’d Cherrycoke trapped somewhere in New England, and saddled with
the responsibility of providing entertainment to his snowed-in cousins and nieces.

But yes, it’s pretty overwhelming, and the literary references come fast and furious. I felt
like I was reading Ulysses, and it takes an enormous effort to read. I made it as far as the
intrepid surveyors signing their contracts to measure their eponymous line in the colonies, but
then I went to my bookshelf and found another book.

Beat Reader<br>
_Ann Charter, ed._

Published in 1992, a different Paul gave me this book for my birthday when we were roommates
back in the early 1990s, but I never took it off the bookshelf until October of this year. I was
drawn into the excerpts from Kerouac’s On The Road — reading about the absolute mayhem of Neal
Cassady is like watching a slow motion car crash.

Nonetheless the characters of the period slowly start to emerge, less from the poetry, than from
the brief narrative at the chapter headings introducing each author. I have not read much poetry
in my life, and rather than trying to decide whether I “liked” some of these works, I tried to
think about what they made me feel.

Charles Bukowski’s account of the death of Neal Cassady felt like a senseless loss, a footnote —
someone who inspired so much, who then died of exposure alongside a rural rail track in a remote
area of Mexico. Similarly the depressing vignette of Kerouac by the daughter he never
acknowledged, while most of the rest of the so called “beats” followed conventional academic
careers, indistinguishable from the rest of the boomers and NIMBYs of their generation.

A Timeless Way of Building<br>
_Christopher Alexander_

I’ve owned this book for years, and spent about an hour searching the house for it a couple of
months ago, until I found it on my daughter’s bookshelf. I’ve skimmed it a few times but never
read it from cover to cover before. This time I was looking for motivation and a mental
framework to help me tackle the architectural design challenges I had inadvertently taken on
when trying to build a level editor for my RPG system.

This is the first of two books that were popularized by the software design patterns community
about 20 years ago. The second book, A Pattern Language, is more popular with that community,
but this book provides the philosophical underpinnings of pattern languages and introduces them
as part of a broader approach to building things. It is much more abstract and doesn’t fit into
a neat narrative.

His approach is uncompromising, and he’s very much opposed to “cookie cutter” parts fitting
together as part of a mechanical construction mindset. I don’t know how he reacted to the
software people taking up his ideas, but it really struck me how conservative he was in his
thoughts about building materials and design techniques. He certainly did not seem to be a fan
of the use of computers or modern industrial technologies for building construction.

In one of the later chapters he describes the design and construction of a house, without floor
plans. The entire thing was laid out with stakes, with columns and panels placed to follow the
step by step realization of each pattern in the order of their importance. Even the doors vary
in their appearance — they are not constructed from panels, and each opening is uniquely
constructed to follow the language envisioned. The ceiling heights are remarkably low, and the
final result has the feeling of a medieval dwelling, with no regard for modern needs or
expectations of ventilation, heating, or electricity.
