NCSA Mosaic was released on Jan 23, 1993 —— so we really are looking at almost exactly 30 years this week.

Had a bit of a rambly discussion yesterday about the distributed web with some folks with a lot of technical experience,
but who (as you might imagine) are generally dissatisfied with the state of technology and the way that the Internet has
evolved.

However rather than a lot of technical stuff, what really seems important is to lay out some principles about how we can
make things better.

However, there are a lot of manifestos out there already. Let's have a look at some of them.
