## 6. ’Subtle is the Lord . . .’

**The Michelson-Morley Experiment**

In his entry for _Ether_ in The Encyclopedia Britannica, published in 1878, Maxwell complained that ‘all space had been
filled three or four times over with aethers.’ He felt that second-order effects of the motion of the Earth through the
aether (that is, $$v/c$$) were too small to be measured, but he held out hope that the first-order effects ($$v^2/c^2$$)
could be detected.

_Here I am struggling with the concept of first-order and second-order effects; I assume it is
apparent in the mathematics, hence the characterization in parentheses above, but I am not sure;— this idea comes up
repeatedly in this chapter._

Along with most of his contemporaries, Maxwell believed strongly in the presence of the _aether_;— according to the
definition by Augustin Jean Fresnel, ‘a medium in a state of absolute rest relative to the fixed stars, in which light
is propagated, and through which the Earth moves as if transparent to it — then the ”Jupiter effect” is of first order
in the velocity of the solar system relative to this aether.’

I was not familiar with the Jupiter Effect until I found [Greg Gbur’s blog](https://skullsinthestars.com/).
In particular his post on
[Measuring the Speed of Light](https://skullsinthestars.com/2008/03/21/relativity-measuring-the-speed-of-light/)
explains Ole Christensen Rømer’s measurements of the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter allowed him to come up with a
reasonable
[measurement of the speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light),
in 1676.

The blog also provides an explanation of
[Fizeau’s experiment](https://skullsinthestars.com/2008/07/05/what-a-drag-aragos-experiment-1810/)


These attempts to describe motion relative to the ether, which must have seemed appropriate to most scientists in
the late 19th century, are confusing to a modern reader already familiar with the basic ideas of relativity and
over 100 years of progress in astrophysics. I am struggling with these effects, especially in the context of
Frizeau’s experiment.

Michelson determined that the motion of the Earth relative to the ether would be detectable as approximately 1/25 of
the wavelength of yellow light. He constructed an interferometer with the necessary precision and concluded from his
experiments that there was no evidence for an ”aether wind”.

Dayton Clarence Miller repeated these experiments with Morley across a hilltop in 1904 and claimed to detect a wind. It
was when Einstein heard about these results that he made the famous statement “Raffiniert ist der Herr Gott, aber
boshaft ist er nicht” (Subtle is the Lord, but malicious He is not). Miller received a $1000 award for this discovery,
and Einstein was bombarded with requests to comment. He said ”I have not for a moment taken \[Miller’s\] results
seriously” and “quantum field theory has drastically changed our perceptions of the vacuum, but that has nothing to do
with the aether of the nineteenth century and earlier, which is gone for good.”

Einstein was unquestionably familiar with Michelson’s experiments before 1905, but he never referenced them in his
paper on special relativity. In the early 1950s, when he was very ill, Einstein gave conflicting explanations as to
why he did not credit Michelson’s work, but also claimed that these results were not necessary for the theory,
because it was already sufficient due to aberration and the results of Fizeau’s experiment.

_1. Aberration_

A star which would be at the zenith with respect to a fixed Earth, would appear at an angle $$\alpha$$ if the Earth was
moving through an aether with velocity $$v$$, where

$$\begin{equation} \tan(\alpha) = v/c \end{equation}$$

It seems obvious to me that no such measurement has ever been made.

_2. Fizeau‘s Experiment_

Fresnel predicted that light moving through a liquid-filled tube with refractive index of $$n$$, a velocity $$v$$ with
respect to the aether, and in the same direction, then the net light velocity $$c'$$ is given by

$$\begin{equation} c' = \frac{c}{n} + v \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) \end{equation}$$

The factor $$1 - 1 / n^2$$ is known as Fresnel’s drag coefficient, and expresses that light cannot acquire the
additional velocity $$v$$ since it is partially held back by the aether in the tube.

In 1851, Fizeau projected light from a terrestrial source into a tube filled with water, and his experimental results
were in reasonable agreement with Fresnel’s predictions.

_3. Lorentz’ Interpretations_

* Poincaré wrote about many features usually associated with relativity before Einstein
  * The question of simultaneity
* FitzGerald and Lorentz also wrote about before Einstein
  * Length compression proportional to $$v^2/c^2$$

I‘ve got a lot to sort out here; in particular I was confused about these aether experiments, what they claimed to
be investigating, how they were carried out, and the consensus before Einstein came along. The Skulls in the Stars
blog was especially helpful to explain which of these theories were _**wrong**_ because Pais doesn‘t just come out
and say it. He is very much trying to present things in the context of the time, and there was of course much
uncertainty about the theories that we take for granted now, and there was really no alternative.

Even now, the _quantum properties of the vacuum_ might as well be _luminiferous aether_ as a matter of terminology.
Even if we dig into the underlying mathematics, the philosophical foundations are still shaky, over 100 years later.


## 7. The New Kinematics

**June 1905: Special Relativity Defined, Lorentz Transformations Derived**

_1. Relativity’s Aesthetic Origins_

The “sensible prejudice” of nineteenth century scientists was that light waves required a carrying medium, just as
sound waves do. As light was better understood, the properties of the aether were further restricted.

Once light was understood as a transverse wave phenomenon, the aether was declared to be quasi-rigid, in essence,
the fixed universal reference frame against which all motion should be measured.

The special theory of relativity eliminated the need for the aether’s essential property, absolute rest, and so the
aether itself became redundant.

In a lecture in Kyoto, in 1922, Einstein revealed that he had struggled to reconcile these conflicting ideas for over a
year. Just five weeks before he published his 1905 paper, he visited Michele Angelo Besso in Bern, whom he knew from his
work at the patent office, and from his student days in Zürich, “to battle on the question.” He then returned the next
day, and without greeting him, he said “Thank you, I’ve completely solved the problem.”

Einstein said that the solution was that the very concept of time is not absolutely defined, but that it is
inseparable from the velocity of a signal used \[to convey the passage of time\].

“The loyal assistance of my friend, M. Besso” was acknowledged in Einstein’s 1905 paper, but he made no reference to
the Michelson-Morley experiment that is now commonly considered to be a critical breakthrough in ruling out the
existence of the stationary aether.

Einstein extended this concept to Maxwell’s model of charged particle moving through magnetic fields.

_2. The Two Postulates_

1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial reference frames
2. In any inertial frame, the speed of light $$c$$ is the same whether the light is emitted from a body at rest or
   by a body in uniform motion

FitzGerald and Lorentz introduced a third postulate, called the _contraction hypothesis_ to explain the results of the
Michelson-Morley experiment.

They believed that the contraction was a dynamic effect: objects in motion experienced a reduction in size that was
different from objects at rest. Einstein explained how this contraction was a consequence of these two hypotheses,
and a third postulate is neither necessary nor desirable.

His insight was that the quantity Lorentz introduced as _local time_ can simply be defined as _time_;— there is no
need for an auxiliary value.

_3. From the Postulates to the Lorentz Transformations_

Einstein proceeded to derive the Lorentz transformations directly from these principles

$$\begin{equation}
  x' = \gamma (x - vt) \hspace{3em}
  y' = y  \hspace{3em}
  z' = z   \hspace{3em}
  t' = \gamma (t - vx / c^2)
\end{equation}$$

where

$$\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\end{equation}$$

_4. Applications_

a) The Lorentz transformations, as discussed

b) From the Lorentz transformations to the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction of distance and dilation of time:

$$\begin{equation}
  \gamma \, l = l_0 \hspace{3em}
  t = \gamma \, t_0
\end{equation}$$

where $$l_0$$ and $$t_0$$ are a length and duration in the rest frame, respectively.

c) The addition of velocities, $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$

Because the Lorentz transformation is a group, with two successive applications with velocities $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ in
the same direction, the formula results in a velocity $$v$$ given by

$$\begin{equation} v = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + v_1 v_2 / c^2} \end{equation}$$

d) The relativistic expression of aberration from the zenith

$$\begin{equation}  \tan \alpha = \gamma \frac{v}{c} \end{equation} $$

e) The transformation law for light frequencies

f) He did not derive the Fresnel formula

$$\begin{equation}
c' = \frac{c}{n} + v (1 - 1 / n^2)
\end{equation}$$

This result immediately follows from (c) by setting $$v_1 = c / n$$ and $$v_2 = v$$ and expanding to the first order
in $$v_1 v_2 / c^2$$.

g) The so-called _clock paradox_

If two clocks $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$ are synchronized at their initial positions, and if $$C_2$$ leaves $$A$$ along a
closed orbit, upon return to $$A$$, then $$C_2$$ will be slow compared to $$C_1$$. Einstein denies that this is
paradoxical, because $$C_2$$, but not $$C_1$$ is subject to acceleration.

h) Covariance of the electrodynamic equations

Einstein derived an expression for the Lorentz force from “the purely electrical force acting on a charged particle
that is instantaneously at rest.” He also derived an expression for the electrical energy $$W$$ for the case where
accelerations are small, and so the energy is lost in the form of radiation is negligible

$$\begin{equation}
W = \int K'_{x'}dx' = m \int_{0}^{v} \gamma^3 vdv = mc^2(\gamma - 1)
\end{equation}$$

As $$v$$ approaches $$c$$, $$W$$ will approach infinity. This is where Einstein said “velocities greater than light
have . . . no possibilities of existence.”

Pais goes on about tachyons, but admits there is no theoretical description of their interactions.

_5. Relativity Theory and Quantum Theory_

Einstein considered his own work in quantum theory to be phenomenological, and not foundational. This is in sharp
contrast to his relativity theory, which he regarded as a true theory with clearly defined first principles.

_6. I Could Have Said That More Simply_

In February 1944, Einstein donated a handwritten manuscript of his 1905 paper to be auctioned, with the winning sum of
$6.5 million contributed by the Kansas City Life Insurance Company. Helen Dukas reported that he made this comment
when she was dictating the text of the paper to him.

**September 1905: About $$\pmb{E = m c^2}$$**

His proof that ’the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content‘ was based on the difference in energy of a
body at rest emitting a plane of light with energy $$L/2$$ in each direction, and that seen from an inertial
reference frame moving with a velocity $$v$$ in the $$x$$ direction.

He demonstrated that by giving off the energy $$L$$ in the form of radiation, the body‘s mass will then be
diminished by $$L/c^2$$.

He mentioned that this might be experimentally verified with the example of radium salts, but after publication he
was not convinced that this would be practical, due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently precise measurements.

Nevertheless, by 1930, nuclear physicists had already established that a free proton weighs 6.7MeV more than one bound
in a helium nucleus, and by 1937 it was possible to calculate the velocity of light with an accuracy greater than 99.5%,
based on nuclear experiments where the masses of the initial and final products, and the energy released in the
reactions were known.

**Early Responses**

Max Planck was one of the first physicists to respond to Einstein’s paper, and the first to publish a paper
referencing his work, and Planck’s assistant von Laue was one of the first to visit him in Bern.

In 1907, Einstein’s former teacher from Zürich, Herman Minkowski gave a colloquium about relativity in which he used
tensors to simplify the mathematical notation used to describe the Lorentz transformations. Minkowski used vectors
with respect to the Lorentz group to describe the electromagnetic potentials and current densities, and the
electromagnetic field strengths form a second-rank tensor (the German term used by Minkowski was Traktor).

Later Minkowski published a paper where for the first time the Maxwell-Lorentz equations are presented in their
modern tensor form;— he also pointed out the inadequacies of Newtonian gravitational theory from the relativistic
point of view, and introduced the terms _spacelike vector_, _timelike vector_, _light cone_, and _world line_.

Einstein was initially annoyed about this treatment, calling it _überflüssige Gelehrsamkeit_ (superfluous
learnedness), but in 1912 he also adopted tensor methods and in 1916 acknowledged that Minkowski helped him to make
the transition from special to general relativity.

In 1912, Wilhelm Wien, the Nobel laureate in physics for 1911, recommended the prize to be shared by Lorentz and
Einstein for their work in discovering the theory of relativity.

**Einstein and the Special Theory After 1905**

Einstein quickly lost interest in the special theory, preferring to let others explore the implications and
applications of his model.

He published several papers between 1906 and 1911 covering important topics such as the relativistic behaviour of
rigid bodies, and the transverse Doppler effect.

**Electromagnetic Mass: The First Century**

Pais sees the phenomenon of electromagnetic mass as a precursor to chapter 8. (_Why? Because he wants to provide an
example of something we still don‘t understand, to put in context the uncertainty faced by all these scientists when
faced with poorly understood phenomena that demand revolutionary advances._)

Electromagnetic mass is a form of energy arising from a charged particle coupled with its own electromagnetic field.
This is a problem pursued by Abraham, Lorentz, and Poincaré, whose investigations have long been irrelevant. The
one thing that remains is that we still don‘t understand the problem (_circa 1982 when Pais wrote this book — I
wonder how things have changed, and how the discovery of the Higgs Boson affects this question_).

Original formulations of the problem involved using formulas derived by Stokes, who examined the energy of rigid
spheres moving through viscous fluids. In 1881, J. J. Thomson calculated a value $$\mu$$ for charged particles
moving through an electric field, which we would call the electromagnetic mass. Lorentz determined that this mass
is not a constant, but must increase with velocity.

Later Max Abraham and Walter Kaufmann calculated that the deflections observed should provide an estimate of the
energy/mass ratio $$e/m$$ to be on the order of $$10^7$$, but even for a hydrogen atom, then the smallest known
particle, $$e/m$$ is only about $$10^4$$. They failed to conclude that the charged particle must have been much
smaller than a hydrogen atom, an observation made by J. J. Thomson in a lecture he gave on cathode rays on the 30th of
the same month. He was consequently credited with the discovery of the electron.

Abraham, Lorentz, and Poinaré continued to develop a theoretical model of the electron as a hard sphere, whose mass
is purely electromagnetic in nature. Kaufmann‘s experiments in 1906 were incompatible with the Lorentz-Einstein
formulation, instead favouring Abraham’s theory. Planck, Poincaré and Lorentz did not find this evidence compelling,
however, and Einstein was unmoved, saying that these theories were improbable. Soon afterwards, Bucherer’s
experiments obtained results that were more consistent with Einstein’s predictions, which eventually became accepted
by 1914-16.

The classical model of using the energy-velocity-momentum formulations to determine the electron’s mass was
effectively discredited by relativity, as was the idea of treating it as a finite sphere. The true nature of the
problem is in the domain of quantum field theory.

## 8. The Edge of History

The definition of _The Edge of History_ is quite interesting. While history itself is subjective,— after all, one can be
definitively wrong about many things that occurred in the past, but one can never be sure about being right,— but the
questions that can be asked about agreed facts in the historical record (in this case, who published what, and when),
will never have definitive answers. For Pais, this is the _edge_ he is referring to.

With that explanation in place, Pais offers his responses to the following questions:

1. Why was Einstein so reluctant to acknowledge the influence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on his thinking?
2. Why could Lorentz never let go of the idea of the aether?
3. Why did Poincaré never understand relativity?

Part of the reason I was so confused while reading Chapter 6 was that it did actually seem to me that Poincaré and
Lorentz had already hit on two of the key ideas of relativity (the illusion of simultaneity and length dilation); —
in fact, the subtle differences between their thinking and Einstein’s insight is the entire reason that relativity
was such a tremendous breakthrough. Lorentz thought the dilation effect was local, and refused to let go of the idea
of a fixed universal reference frame, and Poincaré never understood that this dilation was a fundamental consequence
of the first two postulates of relativity, that bodies cannot be accelerated past the speed of light, and that the
laws of physics are the same in all reference frames. Pais commented that it is not unlikely that Poincaré had in
fact never read Einstein’s 1905 paper.

It should not be surprising that this is a confusing distinction. One of the wonderful aspects of this biography is
how well Pais conveys the uncertainty in the context of the time when these ideas were first being articulated and
refined. Nobody in 1905 had the perspective of the decades of successful confirmation of these results, and even now,
to say that an abstract physical theory is “right” or “wrong” is something of a distraction, at best. Even as late
as 1956, Max Born suggested that Poincaré was ahead of Einstein (“he did not acquit himself well”).

The answers are speculative. The first, regarding Michelson-Morley, was answered by Einstein (perhaps unconvincingly
to Pais) on several occasions, but the essence seems to be that Einstein had already given up on the idea of a fixed
aether (or universal reference frame, in more modern terms) before the experiment was published. Pais believes that
by as early as 1905 Einstein had embraced theoretical models over experimentation, perhaps as a result of the
breakthrough he experienced in his discussions with his friend Michele Angelo Besso. This response is saved for the
last paragraph of this chapter, and seems more important than his thoughts about the other two questions.
