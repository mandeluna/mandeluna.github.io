Matthew lingered too long in the burial chamber, immersed in the hieroglyphics describing the events depicted there.
When he looked up, the dimly lit chamber was quiet. The rest of the initiates had moved on, unaware that he had been
left behind. Instead of hurrying to catch up with them, he decided to get a closer look at the sarcophagus.

It was not an original item, but it was almost 100 years old. It had been carefully carved from limestone quarried
locally, and the craftsmanship was excellent.
