### Historical Anomalies

When I was still living in San Jose I worked with a guy named Matt, who told me I should visit
the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum. While I never got a chance to visit, it sounds like an amazing place, but I am really not sure
I believe everything he told me about it.

The museum takes up an entire city block. The architectural design closely follows Egyptian
motifs — “like a Fry’s” I joked, but he didn't laugh. He seemed genuinely taken by the beauty
of the place. He told me there is a lovely garden out back, with many varieties of roses and
other plants, and fountains everywhere, but he said it was the interior that he found the most
striking.

There is a large collection of artifacts, which is not surprising, and in the basement there
is a detailed mockup of a burial chamber. Upstairs there is a reading room filled with religious
pamphlets from the 19th and early 20th centuries, which sits adjacent to a temple with an altar,
which did not seem to be used during the day.

“Is it a religion or a museum?” I asked. “It's both — no question,” he said. ”When I asked
to find out more about it, they told me to give them my phone number, and they’d be in touch.”

A few days later he said they got in touch. A couple of people came by his house and asked him
some innocuous questions, to get some idea about his background I supposed, but he said the one
thing they really wanted to know, was whether he believed in a Supreme Being.

“They didn't care about which religion I belonged to, but it was important for them to know
that I felt there was some sort of higher power. I told them yes, I absolutely believed that.
They also asked if I would be willing to swear to complete secrecy. It seemed kind of weird,
but I’ve signed a lot of NDAs, so it was no big deal to me. I never take that stuff seriously
anyhow.” The topic of conversation quickly changed to mundane topics, and they left him.

It wasn't until several weeks later that he mentioned it again.
