### Economics

I picked up a copy of David Graeber’s [Debt: The first 5,000 Years](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6617037-debt),
after an animated discussion about debt with a friend on New Year’s Eve. After reading
[The Dawn of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56269264-the-dawn-of-everything) I expected to be
challenged and surprised immediately, and I have not been disappointed.

### Myth

Some essays from the London Review of Books:

_[From Asgard to Valhalla: The Remarkable History of the Norse Myths](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v30/n01/tom-shippey/gloomy-cheerful)_
<br>_by Heather O’Donoghue._

Norse Mythology dominates popular culture to a surprising extent, considering that there are only a handful of
original sources, none of which were translated to Latin until 1665.

_[Cleopatra: Histories, Dreams and Distortions](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v12/n06/mary-beard/give-her-a-snake)_
<br>_by Lucy Hughes-Hallett._

In spite of her epic ability to outmaneuver the Romans, Cleopatra is not a feminist icon, but I think the snake is
overrated.

_[Helen of Troy: From Homer to Hollywood](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v32/n19/marina-warner/did-she-go-willingly)_
<br>_by Laurie Maguire._

The famous lines by Marlowe, usually declaimed in rapture, can be read as inflected with irony and doubt: ‘Was this
the face that launched a thousand ships?’

Marlowe is also famous for writing the first dramatization of the _Faust_ legend, in 1604,
_[The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/christopher-marlowe/the-tragical-history-of-doctor-faustus)_,
which was performed only once before he died after taking a knife to the eye in a bar fight.
The [CBC radio play](https://archive.org/details/dr-faustus-cbc-2001/Part+One.mp3) is available on the Internet
Archive.

_[The Atlantis Story: A Short History of Plato’s Myth](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v30/n12/james-davidson/plato-made-it-up)_
<br>_by Pierre Vidal-Naquet, translated by Janet Lloyd._

The neo-atlantean woo drives me a bit crazy, but who doesn’t love an over the top _History Channel_ documentary now
and then?

_[Medea](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n23/marina-warner/diary)_
<br>_by Marina Warner._

I am mostly unfamiliar with [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_(play)) — the classics are pretty stuffy,
don’t deny it — but after reading this I went down a bit of a Wikipedia rabbit hole, and I’ve added
the [1969 Maria Callas film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_(1969_film)) to my list.

The article about [Alphonse Mucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha) is a delight.
[Ivan Lendl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Lendl) has one of the world’s largest collection of Mucha’s works.

### Society

Last week we had a fun discussion on Signal about mass delusional events that seem to be a cultural phenomenon that
simply won’t go away.

Between the 14th and 17th centuries a recurring social phenomenon of
[Dancing Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_mania) swept Europe. Nobody knows what caused it, and most of
the theories are unconvincing. In particular, the symptoms are not consistent with
[ergotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergotism), and anyway, the psychoactive properties of certain [hydrolyzed
compounds of ergotamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) are also a completely different
thing.

This got me thinking about the effort to book our camping trip this year over the weekend of
the [solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer), and other possibilities to escape from city life. The
impressive endurance of Danish cultural legacies drew my attention to this passage:

_Bonfires are lit in order to repel witches and other evil spirits, with the burnings sending the "witch" away to
Bloksbjerg, the [Brocken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocken)
mountain in the Harz region of Germany where the great witch gathering was thought to be held on this day._

Goethe described the Brocken in his _Faust_, first published in 1808, as the center of revelry for witches
on Walpurgisnacht (30 April; the eve of St Walpurga's Day).

_Now, to the Brocken, the witches ride;<br>
The stubble is gold and the corn is green;<br>
There is the carnival crew to be seen,<br>
And Squire Urianus will come to preside.<br>
So over the valleys, our company floats,<br>
With witches a-farting on stinking old goats._

I‘ve added [The Harz Witches’ Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harzer_Hexenstieg) to my plans for my next hiking
trip in Europe.

### Folk Music

Speaking of farting goats, this weekend I learned that
[_Sumer is icumen in_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer_is_icumen_in) is the boisterous theme sung by the villagers
during the shocking climax of the 1973 film, [The Wicker Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wicker_Man), and I also
discovered the 2020 folk compilation named after the song,
[Sumer Is Icumen In: The Pagan Sound of British and Irish Folk 1966–75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer_Is_Icumen_In:_The_Pagan_Sound_of_British_and_Irish_Folk_1966%E2%80%9375).

The official playlist on Wikipedia is incomplete (I made
[another list with the missing tunes](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Wpa9wVZK79B0mv-y55pLccVl13CPGUV), based on the
Wikipedia article). I’ve come across some gems, many of which are worthy of their own rabbit holes.

I was particularly taken by [Mad Tom of Bedlam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_o%27_Bedlam), and of course I keep
coming back to [Tam Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_Lin) and its themes of transformation.
I am especially fond of [this version](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=47z5n7p9B3I).
