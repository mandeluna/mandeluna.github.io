I spent most of yesterday exploring some different options to create a non-static blog. I'm currently building this
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosting it on [GitHub](https://github.com/mandeluna). I love that I can focus
on the text without character limits. 280 characters is great for keeping me from getting long-winded, but it's no
substitute for an editor. Very few of us read past the headlines anymore, and I think it is worth slowing down a bit
sometimes.

I also love the simplicity of a static site, but I want to publish more than just text. There is some great software for
the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) out there that's evolved over the years. I read
the [MicroPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) spec, I read about [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/), and I made some
pretty good progress with [IndieKit](https://getindiekit.com/); it's excellent, but the complexity is a bit more than I
want to deal with. I don't want a complex server environment to manage, and I certainly don't want to maintain a
database.

Nevertheless, I want to be more focused on writing this year, mostly because I've been reading a lot, and I want to
improve my understanding of what I read.

And I still want images, so I'm going to build something that is a bit more distributed. My phone and my laptop are
powerful computers. I'll let them do the work, and upload it to a simple static site. Later if it gets more
complicated, it will all be locally processed.

I'll make my work public, and I'll talk about it here. Hopefully you will find it useful.
